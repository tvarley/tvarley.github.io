## Introduction

As an engineer it is worth running through the  problems listed at the project euler website. It is always fun and  useful as either a refresher for a know language or as a learning exercise for a new language. I have done this exercise several times for lanugages I have been interested in.  They are usually throwaway projects but I have recently decided to publish them as I work on them.

The first one I am to publishing is the C++ version.  I started over recently just as refresher.

From the Project Euler Website:

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
