## Problem

[euler002.rs](https://gitlab.com/tvarley/euler/-/blob/master/rust/src/euler002.rs)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Answer**: 4613732

## Solution

[euler002.rs](https://gitlab.com/tvarley/euler/-/blob/master/rust/src/euler002.rs)

{% highlight rust %}
pub fn sum_even_fib(upper: u32) -> u32
{
  let mut fib1 = 1;
  let mut fib2 = 1;
  let mut result = 0;
  let mut summed = 0;

  while result < upper {
    if (result % 2) == 0 {
      summed += result;
    }

    result = fib1 + fib2;
    fib2 = fib1;
    fib1 = result;
  }
  return summed;
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn euler_002() {
        assert_eq!(sum_even_fib(4_000_000), 4613732);
    }
}
