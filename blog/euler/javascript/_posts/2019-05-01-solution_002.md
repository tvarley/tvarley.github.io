## Problem

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Answer**: 4613732

## Solution

[solution002.js](https://gitlab.com/tvarley/euler/blob/master/javascript/src/euler/solution002.js)

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = {
  answer : () => {
    var fib1 = 1;
    var fib2 = 1;
    var result = 0;
    var summed = 0;

    while (result < 4000000) {
      if ((result % 2) == 0) {
        summed += result;
      }

      result = fib1 + fib2;
      fib2 = fib1;
      fib1 = result;
    }
    return summed;
  }
};

{% endhighlight %}
