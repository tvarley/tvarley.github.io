## Problem

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
then there are $$3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$$ letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out
in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens.
For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and
115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters.
The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with
British usage.

**Answer**: 21124
