## Problem

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

<img src="/images/p015.gif" alt="Euler 015"/>

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

**Answer:** 137846528820

## Solution

[euler015.rb](https://gitlab.com/tvarley/euler/blob/master/ruby/lib/euler015.rb)

{% highlight ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def lattice_paths(grid_size)
  grid_dimension = grid_size + 1
  grid = Array.new(grid_dimension * grid_dimension) { 1 }
  (grid_size - 1).downto(0) do |x|
    (grid_size - 1).downto(0) do |y|
      pos = (y * grid_dimension) + x
      grid[pos] = grid[pos + 1] + grid[pos + grid_dimension]
    end
  end
  grid[0]
end

puts lattice_paths(20) if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
{% endhighlight %}
