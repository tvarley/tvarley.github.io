## Problem

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Answer: 25164150

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main( int argc , char* argv[])
{
  uint64_t sum_square = 0;
  uint64_t square_sum = 0;

  for(size_t i = 101; --i ;)
  {
    sum_square += (i*i);
    square_sum += i;
  }

  cout << (square_sum*square_sum) - sum_square << endl;
}
```
