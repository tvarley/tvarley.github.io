## Problem

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Answer**: 4613732

## Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main( int argc , char* argv[] )
{
  long fib1 = 1;
  long fib2 = 1;
  long result = 0;
  long summed = 0;

  // TODO: Do we really need to
  // calcuate every fib # in the sequence?
  while (result < 4000000) {
    if ((result % 2) == 0) {
      summed += result;
    }

    result = fib1 + fib2;
    fib2 = fib1;
    fib1 = result;
  }

  cout << summed << endl;
}
```
