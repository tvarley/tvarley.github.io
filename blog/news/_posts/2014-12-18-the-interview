The Interview
-------------

Sony Entertainment pulled the feature film 'The Interview' from worldwide distribution yesterday.

The decision to pull the movies was prompted by threat by a group of terroist hackers.
This hacker group has been linked to the North Korean government.
The North Korean govenment is upset at the unflattering representation of the North Korean leader (Kim Jong-un).

Pulling the movie is a victory for the hacking group.

I would have liked to see the movie released to the movies as planned.
