Most of my career has been spent working with start ups with a focus in financial services.  I held senior technical positions providing development and management which led to sucessful liquations.

I have recently become interested in how big data teamed with crowd colaboration can solve problems in interesting ways.  The hard part is not  necessarily creating interesting solutions -- the real issue is finding problems that the crowd wants to solve.  

Many projects are started with great technical teams and innovative solutions but without an understanding of what the system is supposed to solve these projects are destined to be a solution looking for a problem.  I focus a team enabling it to to deliver value and not waste time on 'show and tell' projects.

This is a personal blog and as such will contain all manner of content.
