Most of my career has been spent working with start ups with a focus in financial services. I have been responsible for all aspects of system definition, development, quality assurance, delivery and support. My official job descriptions have ranged from individual contributor to C level technical positions.

I have recently become interested in how big data teamed with crowd colaboration can used in interesting ways. The hard part is not necessarily creating innovative platforms -- the real issue is finding something the crowd wants to swarm to.

This is a personal blog and as such will contain all kinds of subject matter, my discretion.
