Most of my career has been spent working with start ups with a focus in financial services.  I held senior technical positions providing development and management which led to sucessful liquations.

I have recently become interested in how big data teamed with crowd colaboration can solve problems in interesting ways.  The hard part is not  necessarily creating interesting solutions, it is finding problems that the crowd wants to solve.

This is a personal blog and is mainly for my amusement. It should be viewed as such.  Most of the content will likely be 'downtime' moments or pre bed time rants.
