Most of my career has been spent working with start ups with a focus in financial services.  I held senior technical positions providing development and management which led to sucessful liquations.

I have recently become interested in how publically available or sourced data teamed with internet based collobation can solve problems in interesting ways.  The hard part is finding an interesting enough problem and folk want to solve (interesting or not).

This is a personal blog and is mainly for my amusement. It should be viewed and such.
